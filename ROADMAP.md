# Updated 7-Day SAA Implementation Roadmap

## Day 1: SAAs Workers Integration ✅

- [x] Implement SAAsWorkers class in a new file `src/workers.py`
- [x] Add asynchronous execution capabilities for parallel processing
- [x] Integrate SAAsWorkers with the existing Orchestrator class

## Day 2: Enhance Main Assistant and Prompts ✅

- [x] Improve the `_generate_main_prompt` method in `src/orchestrator.py` for better task breakdown
- [x] Implement logic for the MAIN_ASSISTANT to handle tasks without subtask decomposition
- [x] Enhance prompt writing capabilities for SUB_ASSISTANT tasks

## Day 3: Implement Parallel Research Use Case ✅

- [x] Develop a parallel research system in `/src/plugins/comparative_analysis.py`
- [x] Refine the create_assistant function to accept adding new necessary tools for web scraping and data processing
- [x] Write the prompt system that will instruct the MAIN_ASSISTANT to run a deep research objective

## Day 4: CLI Enhancements and Plugin System ✅

- [x] Extend the CLI in `src/main.py` to support new SAAsWorkers functionality
- [x] Implement a plugin system using `pluggy` for extending use cases
- [x] Create commands for custom prompts and plugin selection

## Day 5: Testing and Error Handling ✅

- [x] Update existing tests in `tests/test_orchestrator.py` for new functionality
- [x] Add new tests for SAAsWorkers in `tests/test_workers.py`
- [x] Create tests for the plugin system and CLI in `tests/test_plugins_and_custom_commands.py` and `tests/test_main.py`
- [x] Enhance error handling and logging throughout the project

## Day 6: Documentation and Examples (In Progress)

- [ ] Update the README.md with new features and usage instructions
- [ ] Create example scripts for using plugins and custom prompts
- [ ] Document the SAAsWorkers implementation and integration
- [ ] Add documentation for the plugin system and how to create new plugins

## Day 7: Optimization and Final Testing

- [ ] Optimize parallel execution in SAAsWorkers
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire system
- [ ] Address any remaining bugs or issues
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (if applicable)

# Backlog (Future Development)

1. Implement additional use cases as plugins (e.g., content creation, autocomplete)
2. Enhance the configuration management system
3. Implement a full-featured FastAPI-based API
4. Develop strategies for handling larger workloads and scaling
5. Integrate additional Phidata tools and features
6. Implement long-term memory and knowledge base systems
7. Create a more advanced UI with data visualization capabilities
8. Implement a caching system for frequently used prompts or responses
9. Add support for more LLM providers
10. Develop a system for chaining multiple plugins or use cases
11. Implement a feedback loop for continuous improvement of assistant responses
