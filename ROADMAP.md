# Updated 7-Day SAA Implementation Roadmap

## Day 1: SAAs Workers Integration

- [x] Implement SAAsWorkers class in a new file `src/workers.py`
- [x] Add asynchronous execution capabilities for parallel processing
- [x] Integrate SAAsWorkers with the existing Orchestrator class

## Day 2: Enhance Main Assistant and Prompts

- [ ] Improve the `_generate_main_prompt` method in `src/orchestrator.py` for better task breakdown
- [ ] Implement logic for the MAIN_ASSISTANT to handle tasks without subtask decomposition
- [ ] Enhance prompt writing capabilities for SUB_ASSISTANT tasks

## Day 3: Implement Parallel Research Use Case

- [ ] Develop a parallel research system in `src/use_cases/research.py`
- [ ] Integrate the research use case with SAAsWorkers
- [ ] Add necessary tools for web scraping and data processing

## Day 4: CLI Enhancements and Basic UI

- [ ] Extend the CLI in `src/main.py` to support new SAAsWorkers functionality
- [ ] Implement a basic Streamlit UI for interaction (instead of Sveltekit for time constraints)
- [ ] Create commands for the research use case

## Day 5: Testing and Error Handling

- [ ] Update existing tests in `tests/test_orchestrator.py` for new functionality
- [ ] Add new tests for SAAsWorkers and the research use case
- [ ] Enhance error handling and logging throughout the project

## Day 6: Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Update the README.md with new features and usage instructions
- [ ] Create example scripts for the research use case
- [ ] Document the SAAsWorkers implementation and integration

## Day 7: Optimization and Final Testing

- [ ] Optimize parallel execution in SAAsWorkers
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire system
- [ ] Address any remaining bugs or issues
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (if applicable)

# Backlog (Future Development)

1. Implement additional use cases (e.g., content creation, autocomplete)
2. Develop a plugin system for easy integration of new tools
3. Enhance the configuration management system
4. Implement a full-featured FastAPI-based API
5. Develop strategies for handling larger workloads and scaling
6. Integrate additional Phidata tools and features
7. Implement long-term memory and knowledge base systems
8. Create a more advanced UI with data visualization capabilities
